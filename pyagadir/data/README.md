Lacroix, E., Viguera, A. R., & Serrano, L. (1998). Elucidating the folding problem of α-helices: local motifs, long-range electrostatics, ionic-strength dependence and prediction of NMR parameters. Journal of molecular biology, 284(1), 173-191. https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1998.2145

The paper uses the terminology of Richardson & Richardson (1988) where STC (S, strand; T, turn; and C, coil) indicates a non-helical conformation and He is a helical residue.

## table_1
Free energies in Kcal/mol for the intrinsic tendencies of the different amino acids to be at different positions of an a-helix.
The first column corresponds to the 20 amino acids in one letter. The N-terminus blocking acetyl or succynil groups are indicated by Ac and the C-terminus blocking amide group by Am.
Nc-1 	Normal N-cap values. 
Nc-2 	N-cap values when there is a Pro at position N1.  
Nc-3 	N-cap values when there is a Glu, Asp or Gln at position N3.  
Nc-4 	N-cap values when there is a Pro at position N1 and Glu, Asp or Gln at position N3.  
Cc-1 	Normal C-cap values.  
Cc-2 	C-cap values when there is a Pro residue at position C’.  
N1	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N1. 
N2	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N2.  
N3	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N3.  
N4 	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N4.  
Ncen	Intrinsic helical propensities between N4 and C-cap.  
	    For charged residues these could change depending of the degree of ionisation.  
Neutral	Intrinsic helical propensities at positions higher than N4.


## table_2
Energy contributions in Kcal/mol * 100, of the interactions between different amino acids at positions N' (rows) and N4 (columns) in a hydrophobic staple motif. 

The hydrophobic staple motif is only considered whenever the N-cap residue is Asn, Asp, Ser, Pro or Thr.  The above values are multiplied by 1 in the following cases: i) whenever the N-cap residue is Asn, Asp, Ser, or Thr and the N3 residue is Glu, Asp or Gln. ii) whenever the N-cap residue is Asp or Asn and the N3 residue is Ser or Thr.  In all other cases they are multiplied by 0.5.

## table_3
Energy contributions in cal/mol Kcal/mol * 100 of the interactions between the different amino acids at positions C3 (rows) and C’ (columns), in the Schellman motif. 

The Schellman motif is only considered whenever Gly is the C-cap residue.

## table_4a
Energy contributions in cal/mol Kcal/mol * 100 of the non-charged side chain-side chain interactions between the different amino acids at positions i,i+3. 

The interaction free energies correspond to those between non-charged residues, or in the case of two residues that can be charged to those cases in which at least one of the two is non-charged (the interaction is scaled according to the population of charged and neutral forms of the participating amino acids).  

## table_4b
Energy contributions in cal/mol Kcal/mol * 100 of the non-charged side chain-side chain interactions between the different amino acids at positions i,i+4. 

The interaction free energies correspond to those between non-charged residues, or in the case of two residues that can be charged to those cases in which at least one of the two is non-charged (the interaction is scaled according to the population of charged and neutral forms of the participating amino acids).
