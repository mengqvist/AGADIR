# Data table contents

## table2
Provides assorted energies, including N- and C-capping energies, and intrinsic helix propensity energies.

## table3a
N-terminal dipole energies. Negatively charged residues are stabilizing, positively charged residues are destabilizing.

## table3b
C-terminal dipole energies. Negatively charged residues are destabilizing, positively charged residues are stabilizing.

## table4a
The free energy contribution for side chain interactions between AAi and AAi3. The table is **not** symmetric, the order of the amino acids matter.

## table4b
The free energy contribution for side chain interactions between AAi and AAi4. The table is **not** symmetric, the order of the amino acids matter.
