# α-helix probability model (AGADIR)

**This repository is a work in progress and currently does not produce correct predictions**

An open-source, Python implementation of Munoz & Serrano's AGADIR model of α-helix formation. This model uses statistical mechanics and energy parameters trained on a database of over 400 peptides to predict the α-helical tendency (probability) per residue for a given peptide (see references).

The energy parameters used in this model were extracted from the supplementary material of Lacroix, E., Viguera, A. R., & Serrano, L. (1998). Elucidating the folding problem of α-helices: local motifs, long-range electrostatics, ionic-strength dependence and prediction of NMR parameters. Journal of molecular biology, 284(1), 173-191. https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1998.2145

The paper uses the terminology of Richardson & Richardson (1988) where STC (S, strand; T, turn; and C, coil) indicates a non-helical conformation and He is a helical residue. Python indexing starting from the Ncap is used to describe these positions in the model.

## Installation

### Production Environment

Install the computational environment with Conda (https://conda.io):

```bash
# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate the environment
conda activate agadir

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Development Environment

For development work (including running tests, formatting code, etc.), use the development environment:

```bash
# Create the development environment
conda env create -f environment-dev.yml

# Activate the development environment
conda activate agadir-dev

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

The development environment includes additional tools:
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive development
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Code quality tools (black, flake8, isort, mypy)

To format and check your code in the development environment:
```bash
# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check code
flake8 .
mypy .
```

## Usage

The most simple way to use this package is to import and invoke the `AGADIR` model directly:
```python
# Initialize model with custom parameters
model = AGADIR(
    method='1s',    # Method for partition function: 'r' (residue) or '1s' (one-sequence)
    T=4.0,         # Temperature in Celsius
    M=0.15,        # Ionic strength in mol/L
    pH=7.0         # pH of solution
)

# Predict with terminal modifications
result = model.predict(
    'ILKSLEEFLKVTLRSTRQT',
    ncap='Z',      # N-terminal acetylation ('Z') or succinylation ('X')
    ccap='B'       # C-terminal amidation ('B')
)
```

The result object provides several methods to access the predictions:
- `get_sequence()`: Returns the input peptide sequence
- `get_percent_helix()`: Returns the mean helical propensity (float)
- `get_helical_propensity()`: Returns the probability for each residue (numpy array)

### Terminal Capping

When predicting helix propensity, the charged termini can significantly affect the results. In real proteins, helices are typically part of a larger sequence and don't experience these terminal charges. The package supports three types of terminal modifications to simulate this:

- N-terminal modifications (ncap):
  - `'Z'`: Acetylation - neutralizes the positive N-terminal charge
  - `'X'`: Succinylation - neutralizes the positive N-terminal charge
- C-terminal modification (ccap):
  - `'B'`: Amidation - neutralizes the negative C-terminal charge

These modifications are particularly important when analyzing helices extracted from larger proteins. For example, if you're predicting the helical propensity of a segment taken from a crystal structure, you should consider adding these caps to better simulate the actual environment where the helix exists within the protein:

```python
# Analyzing a helix segment from a protein structure
segment = "ILKSLEEFLKVTLRSTRQT"
model = AGADIR(method='1s', T=4.0, pH=7.0)
result = model.predict(segment, ncap='Z', ccap='B')  # Add caps to simulate internal protein environment
```

### Energy Calculations

For detailed analysis, you can use the `EnergyCalculator` class directly to examine specific energy contributions:

```python
from pyagadir.energies import EnergyCalculator

# Initialize calculator
calc = EnergyCalculator(
    pept="ILKSLEEFLKVTLRSTRQT",
    pH=7.0,
    T=277.15,  # Temperature in Kelvin
    ionic_strength=0.15,  # Ionic strength in mol/L
    min_helix_length=6,
    has_acetyl=False,  # N-terminal acetylation 
    has_succinyl=False,  # N-terminal succinylation
    has_amide=False  # C-terminal amidation
)

# Calculate specific energy components
helix_start = 0  # starting position
helix_length = 6 # length of helical segment

# Basic helix energies
intrinsic_energy = calc.get_dG_Int(helix_start, helix_length)  # Returns: np.ndarray
hbond_energy = calc.get_dG_Hbond(helix_start, helix_length)    # Returns: float

# Capping energies
ncap_energy = calc.get_dG_Ncap(helix_start, helix_length)      # Returns: np.ndarray
ccap_energy = calc.get_dG_Ccap(helix_start, helix_length)      # Returns: np.ndarray

# Special motif energies
staple_energy = calc.get_dG_staple(helix_start, helix_length)    # Returns: float
schellman_energy = calc.get_dG_schellman(helix_start, helix_length)  # Returns: float

# Side chain interactions
i3_interactions = calc.get_dG_i3(helix_start, helix_length)    # Returns: np.ndarray
i4_interactions = calc.get_dG_i4(helix_start, helix_length)    # Returns: np.ndarray

# Electrostatic and dipole interactions
electrostatic = calc.get_dG_electrost(helix_start, helix_length)  # Returns: np.ndarray
n_term_macro, c_term_macro = calc.get_dG_terminals_macrodipole(helix_start, helix_length)  # Returns: tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
dipole_n, dipole_c = calc.get_dG_sidechain_macrodipole(helix_start, helix_length)  # Returns: tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
```

Each energy term represents a different contribution to helix stability:
- Intrinsic energies: Base propensities for each residue
- H-bond energy: Main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds
- Capping energies: N- and C-terminal capping effects
- Staple motif: Hydrophobic interactions between N' and N4 residues
- Schellman motif: Special C-terminal capping interaction with glycine
- i,i+3 and i,i+4 interactions: Side chain interactions
- Electrostatic: Charged residue pair interactions
- Macrodipole: Interactions between charged residues and the helix dipole


## Validation

The implementation has been validated against the original AGADIR paper results. To run the validation:

1. Activate the development environment (required for matplotlib):
```bash
conda activate agadir-dev
```

2. Run the validation script:
```bash
python ./pyagadir/validation.py
```

This will generate comparison plots in the `pyagadir/figures` directory. 

Below is a validation plot for Figure 3b with reference data extractedfrom the original paper (Lacroix et al., 1998, using WebPlotDigitizer), showing the pH dependence of helix content:

Below is a validation plot for Figure 4 with reference data extractedfrom the original paper (Lacroix et al., 1998, using WebPlotDigitizer), showing the pH dependence of helix content:

## Questions / To Do
* Based on the validation plots, the model generally shows the correct trend, but some of the pH-dependent electrostatic energies look like they need work.
* Test correct functioning of staple term or schellman term.
* We need to locate a source for the N- and C-terminal pKa values for the individual amino acids. Currently using average value from Stryer.
* Update pytests to fit new model.
